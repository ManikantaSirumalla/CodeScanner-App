# CodeScanner App

The CodeScanner App is a simple iOS application that allows users to scan both QR codes and barcodes using a custom framework. This app demonstrates how to integrate and use the QRScannerFramework to scan and detect codes.

## Features
- **Scan QR Codes:** Easily scan QR codes with the press of a button.
- **Scan Barcodes:** Scan barcodes for various applications.
- **Custom Framework Integration:** The app integrates the QRScannerFramework for code scanning.
- **Delegate Pattern:** Demonstrates the use of the delegate pattern to handle code scanning events.

## Installation

To run this app, you'll need Xcode and CocoaPods. If you haven't installed CocoaPods, you can do so using the following command:

```shell
gem install cocoapods
```

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeScanner-App.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd CodeScanner-App
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```shell
pod install
```

4. Open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

5. Build and run the app on your iOS device or simulator.

## Usage

1. The app provides two main buttons, "Scan QR Code" and "Scan Barcode."

2. Press the corresponding button to activate the scanner.

3. Point the camera at the QR code or barcode to start scanning.

4. The scanned code will be displayed, and a message will be printed to the console.

## Custom Framework

The app uses a custom framework called QRScannerFramework for code scanning. The framework encapsulates the scanning functionality and allows easy integration into other projects.
